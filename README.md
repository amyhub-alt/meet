# React + Vite
# Event Finder App

This project is a web application that helps users find and explore events in various cities. The app provides features such as filtering events by city, viewing event details, and accessing the app offline. Users can also add the app as a shortcut to their home screen for quick access and visualize event details through interactive charts.

##  Overview

Meet is a progressive web app (PWA) built with **React** and **Vite** that allows users to discover upcoming events in various cities.

##  Testing

- Unit and integration tests written using **Jest**
- End-to-end feature testing using **Cucumber** and **Gherkin syntax**

##  PWA Features
